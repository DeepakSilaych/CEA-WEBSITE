                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              Economic losses from moderate earthquake events centered close to a metropolis can
                              potentially wreak havoc on local economies and small countries. Recent studies suggest
                              that every dollar spent on a resilient infrastructure translates to $13 in avoided losses.
                              And yet, seismic losses have not created the same political or economic imperative as
                              other risks, such as diseases or financial crises. In this presentation, we will discuss
                              different ways to bridge the paramount gap between the state-of-the-art knowledge of
                              performance-based earthquake engineering and the development of next-generation seismic
                              design standards. Twofold issues arise in this quest. First is the trade-off between the
                              rigors expected from a structural engineer and the predictable performance of the built
                              infrastructure. The second issue is that of setting the target performance itself. With
                              the help of extensive studies on two different lateral load-resisting systems, we will
                              discuss the proposed calibration of seismic design factors to meet probabilistic
                              performance targets. We then address ways to set the target performance. We will conclude
                              the presentation with a discussion on the ongoing thrusts of the global earthquake
                              engineering community to achieve resilient infrastructure.

                              Excavations / shoring works are carried out in difficult ground conditions, particularly
                              in design and execution phase, as well as reliably conducted supervision by personnel
                              having the appropriate skill and experience, but also well-defined and suitable
                              methodology of construction is required. Often geotechnical engineers and construction
                              team for excavation/shoring works faces many challenges including design, methodology,
                              equipment utilized for the project. Errors in any of these steps will lead to failures.
                              Description of few deep excavation projects implemented with different techniques
                              including secant pile wall, contiguous pile wall, sheet pile wall and in various ground
                              conditions will be presented. Similar challenges in executing marine works especially
                              construction of marine structures including project executed will be presented.

                              In a mostly urban world, cities are the centre stage of all social, economic, and
                              geographic interactions. These interactions shape outcomes for everyone. In other words,
                              the physical form of the city shapes inequalities of opportunities and access. The talk
                              will focus on some recent research results looking at the relationships between city size
                              and economic, physical, and network inequalities in cities. The scientific results will be
                              used to reflect and evaluate planning policy, especially the ideas of accessible and
                              liveable neighbourhoods and 30-minute cities.

                              "The talk will focus on some novel and reliable numerical strategies specifically
                              conceived for the evaluation of the level of safety of masonry structures exhibiting major
                              historical importance (towers, churches, aggregates and vaults).


                              The basic requirements of the Italian code and the most diffused numerical techniques
                              available at present will be briefly reviewed, highlighting pros and cons.


                              Then, new simple numerical strategies based mainly on limit analysis, assuming masonry
                              behaving as a no-tension or quasi no-tension material will be introduced.


                              After a thorough revision of the theory, a series of technically meaningful applications
                              will be shown, putting in evidence the potential of limit analysis combined with finite
                              elements and its applicability in common design."

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              In this talk I would like to briefly discuss the various applications of deep learning
                              techniques to the climate index and ocean state prediction. The developed deep learning
                              technique is comprised of Convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory
                              networks (LSTM), these were majorly trained using global ocean states of sea surface
                              temperature anomalies (SST) and vertically averaged sub-surface temperature anomalies
                              (VATA, proxy to heat content). The various application of these deep learning techniques
                              include a long lead prediction of ENSO (Nino 3.4 index) index and East African short rain
                              index (EASRI), subsurface ocean temperature prediction in tropical Indian Ocean at
                              specific location and Region proposal and regression network (RPRN) for fishing spot
                              detection. In these above mentioned applications a higher prediction skills compared to
                              the preceding statistical based and numerical based approaches. In a few applications,
                              ENSO and EASRI prediction, the precursor leading to higher prediction skills, were
                              explored using heatmap techniques. Such deep learning techniques could successfully
                              provide accurate forecasts for other important climate drivers and additionally could
                              serve as potential alternative tool for analyzing their tele-connections.

                              I am Kalpesh R. Patil, graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay from Civil
                              Engineering Department in Feb-2019. My thesis was focused on the improved prediction of
                              Sea surface temperatures using Artificial neural networks supervised by Prof. M. C. Deo.
                              Since then, I have been fascinated about machine learning methods and its application
                              towards scientific solutions. While pursuing the same after the graduation I had
                              opportunity to work in my first post-doc with Prof. Masaaki Iiyama at his laboratory,
                              Iiyama Laboratory in the School of Informatics at Kyoto University where I worked on the
                              efficacy of deep learning against traditional machine learning on the prediction of
                              oceanic states and potential fishing spot detection. After its successful completion I had
                              applied for the JAMSTEC young research fellowship which I fortunately received. This is my
                              second post-doc where I am currently affiliated to the Application Laboratory, JAMSTEC as
                              a Young Research Fellow since Apr-2021 dealing with applications of machine learning for
                              climate index prediction. APL is a leading laboratory provides prediction information
                              using Seasonal Climate Prediction (SINTEX-F) and Regional Ocean Prediction (JCOPE).
                              Additionally, the APL is also extending its interest in the application of machine
                              learning to global and regional predictions. I further plan to grow my interest in
                              applications of deep learning and plan to develop a state-of-the art tool for ocean state
                              and climate index prediction in aid to the current numerical methods.

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              Is AI/ML just the latest fad in engineering research, or is it the game-changer its
                              proponents tell us it is? To answer this we should understand what AI/ML is, what it can
                              do, and see how this fits with the goals of doing research. In this talk I’ll ask those
                              questions, and outline some answers. Along the way, we’ll discover what makes human
                              intelligence so special, and why it is so hard to replicate. Our goal is to properly
                              contextualize the capability of these modern tools within the outcomes we seek. In doing
                              so, we can then draw distinctions between applications of AI/ML that drive insight, and
                              those that simply wallpaper over the cracks in our understanding. At the end, some good
                              books are suggested, as is a Call to Action to the community of engineering research
                              professionals.

                              Cement and concrete industries around the world are going through a transformative change
                              driven not only by a need to be greener and more sustainable on the environmental impact
                              front, but also by a need to be more efficient and productive through automation due to
                              growing shortage of skilled labor. The Sustainable Materials Research and Technology
                              (SMaRT) lab at the Glenn Department of Civil Engineering in Clemson University is
                              addressing these challenges by conducting a range of sponsored research projects. Dr.
                              Rangaraju will present a sampling of on-going research projects that highlight a range of
                              issues being addressed as well as the technical capabilities that are available at Clemson
                              University to conduct these research projects. These projects include: (a) developing
                              alternate binders from pre- and post-consumer glass waste (Nippon Electric Glass, Owens
                              Corning, Inc.) (b) development of an active-rheology based micro-macro robot for 3D
                              printing of concrete for new construction and repairs (National Science Foundation), (c)
                              development and use of UHPC for improving frictional characteristics of pavement and
                              bridge deck surfaces (US Department of Transportation), (d) evaluate the use of
                              high-alkali natural pozzolans as supplementary cementitious materials (National Pozzolan
                              Association) (e) use of alternate binders in cement-modified recycled base for pavement
                              rehabilitation (South Carolina Department of Transportation) (f) evaluate the long-term
                              durability of dry cask concrete storage units for spent nuclear fuel rod disposition (US
                              Department of Energy). The SMaRT lab along with shared lab facilities at Clemson
                              University are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities to support on-going materials

                              Structural health monitoring/assessment is an age-old challenge. Due to inherent
                              complexities, the area has attracted a multidisciplinary research interest. Despite
                              enormous developments, successful implementations of theses concept are limited. The
                              research team of the presenter has been working on the related issues for over 3 decades.
                              The team proposed several novel concepts for health assessment using minimum response
                              information and inspecting only small part of a structure without disrupting its normal
                              operation. Recent catastrophic failures of older or buildings under construction added a
                              new dimension to the overall problem. In this scenario, types of defects, locations, and
                              their severity were known. Rehabilitation actions were proposed but not acted upon in a
                              timely manner due to lack of resources. Some of the related issues include who will
                              inspect, their qualifications, legal standings of the recommendations made by them,
                              acceptable time period to implement their recommendations, and penalty for not carrying
                              out their suggestions, etc. In India, the initiation of a Professional Engineering license
                              requirement, similar to the U.S., is suggested by the presenter to address this
                              complicated problem.

                              Geotechnical practice determining geotechnical parameters conventionally has been from
                              samples extracted from the ground, carrying out in situ tests at relatively larger
                              intervals as in the cases of SPT and PMT, at closer spacing as in CPT & DMT and their
                              variants or over finite distances as in case of cross-hole, downhole or SASW & MASW but
                              never considering, dealing or treating ground as an entity. The main thesis of the
                              presentation is to distinguish the differences in the responses of the ground from an
                              analysis that synthesizes the parameters so obtained conventionally and that from
                              considering the ground as an entity. The responses of a group of students or for that
                              matter of a large group of individuals as in society can not be integrated from their
                              individual responses and one needs sociology to understand the group behaviour. The talk
                              will present a paradigm shift in our approach in understanding, analysis and prediction of
                              the behaviour of ground as required in geotechnical practice drawing parallels from
                              sociology.

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              "The field of Earthquake Engineering has grown many folds over the past several decades.
                              Initially, the primary objective of earthquake resistant design was focused only on life
                              safety. Over the past decade, there has been an increasing demand for not only life safety
                              but also minimizing the property loss as well as minimizing the disruption of operations
                              at various facilities that are essential for a quick recovery from a natural disaster.
                              Such a demand has increased the need for significant improvement in our ability to
                              simulate the linear and nonlinear behavior of structures and industrial systems. It has
                              also increased the need for improvement in our ability to simulate ageing related
                              degradation and damage in structures and components. Large array of sensors are being used
                              to collect data and it is expected to assist us in detecting possible degradation and
                              damage in structures as well as possibly predict when a potential failure might occur.
                              However, we are very far from achieving this goal. In fact, researchers have not been able
                              to fully simulate the exact behavior of complex structures when subjected to large
                              earthquake inputs in a highly controlled environment of a shake table test. For example,
                              simulating the nonlinear behavior of complex concrete structures and establishing an
                              appropriate constitutive model for the nonlinear damage plasticity by itself is quite
                              challenging. There are significant uncertainties that remain in our ability to formulate
                              and simulate the behavior of such complex systems throughout their lifetime. Deploying
                              greater number of sensors, collecting big data, and using modern techniques like
                              Artificial Intelligence by themselves are not likely to provide the solution to the
                              current challenges. Yet, artificial intelligence and probabilistic analytics can provide
                              us better insights into the behavior of complex structural systems. It can eventually help
                              in improving the characterization of constitutive behavior and degradation mechanisms.
                              This seminar will present the results from recent research conducted in this field at the
                              Center for Nuclear Energy Facilities and Structures (CNEFS).


                              An open session would be conducted after the lecture aimed at UG and PG students who might
                              be interested in pursuing higher studies in US."

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              In modern independent India the Civil Engineering education has been focused primarily on
                              technologies that are relevant to modern urban India. But a majority of our population
                              lives in semi-urban, and rural India. In most of the ways, there are huge differences
                              between the two. It is like two different worlds. The differences are in many aspects
                              including resource availability, at individual as well as community level, education,
                              literacy, skill availability, infrastructure, power availability, wages, life style,
                              culture, population density, climate patterns etc. As a result what is appropriate,
                              viable, feasible, or replicable for one is not necessarily so for the other. These are
                              issues of paramount importance when they are linked to one of the basic needs, namely
                              housing. The other major difference is the availability of technical support for projects
                              that one might undertake. Hence, it is important to take cognizance of the options that
                              are suitable for the non-urban or rural context. The lectures will focus on the
                              introduction to various options, their appropriateness for rural setting, focusing on the
                              principal advantages they offer, and their limitations without getting in to hardcore
                              designing. On the other hand, the Indian Subcontinent has a wealth of technical options
                              that have evolved over a millennia, and which are very much relevant today, as they were a
                              century ago. They are rooted in different regions of the country to meet the local needs.
                              They have the potential to meet the local demands while generating much needed local
                              employment. To top it off, many of them have very small carbon footprint. In short they
                              have a potential to improve the living conditions of the locals within their means. The
                              lecture will focus on appropriateness of various options and their connect with the
                              geo-climatic context, their advantages, and performance in recent natural disasters.
                              Finally, while talking about technology options, one cannot leave out the topic of their
                              performance in different contexts and how it could be improved, while taking cognizance of
                              the unprecedented recent hype on skilling. This calls for a look at the disconnect between
                              the engineers who put their ideas on paper and the building artisans who translate them in
                              to reality, and the resulting debacle in the face of the elements and natural disasters,
                              and the way

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              "Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) is one of the design issues, which cannot be ignored for
                              the structures founded on the weak soils particularly when these are subjected to strong
                              excitation. During strong shaking, the behavior of soil is highly nonlinear; further if it
                              is saturated loose sand, the liquefaction may occur. To deal effectively with such complex
                              scenario, numerical modeling provides the best solution. For Soil-Structure Interaction
                              considering earthquake loads, there are a number of important issues which need to be
                              dealt rationally for a reasonably accurate analysis. First issue is modeling of unbounded
                              soil media to satisfy the radiation conditions. Second, for dynamic loading, behavior of
                              soil is frequency dependent and it needs to be taken care. Third is modeling material
                              nonlinearity of soil. Fourth is modeling of liquefaction. To deal with boundary, both
                              simplified and rigorous methods are available.
                              Some of the new upcoming nuclear power plants (NPP) in India are proposed to be founded on
                              the soft soil i.e. alluvium in active seismic zone, necessitating to consider SSI for
                              analysis. Few of these will be founded on Combined Piled-Raft Foundation (CPRF). So far,
                              no study has been reported considering nonlinearity of soil for the NPP structures founded
                              on CPRF considering earthquake loads. The speaker and his research group examined the
                              dynamic responses of raft, pile group and CPRF of a NPP simulating the nonlinear finite
                              element model. The effect of nonlinearity is examined. The study indicated the importance
                              of CPRF over the raft foundation and pile group foundation for the design of nuclear power
                              plants."

                              Design and performance evaluation of traffic control techniques such as ramp metering are
                              typically based on macroscopic traffic flow models. These models, obtained by
                              spatio-temporal averaging of microscopic vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure interactions,
                              do not have sufficient resolution to model safety, or to study the impact of emerging
                              paradigms of autonomy and connectivity. We present coordinated ramp metering algorithms
                              that regulate entry into the freeway network at the vehicle level, based on information
                              about state of vehicles in the network, but do not require information about travel
                              demand. Under these algorithms, each on-ramp operates under cycles during which it does
                              not release more vehicles than its queue size at the beginning of the cycle. Additionally,
                              the algorithms, dynamically, either introduce pause at the end of the cycle, or modulate
                              the release rate during the cycle, or modulate safety distance for release during the
                              cycle. Under standard safe vehicle-following and merging protocols, these algorithms are
                              shown to keep the network undersaturated for maximal travel demand and result in lower
                              travel time than known ramp metering algorithms

                              "Seismic Steel Moment Resisting Frames constructed on the West Coast of the United States
                              during the 1950-1994 era have serious deficiencies in column splices. These deficiencies
                              arise due to a combination of materials and welding practices, before the 1994 Northridge
                              earthquake revealed problems with such construction. Today, these buildings form a large
                              part of the building inventory, and pose a serious life-safety and economic risk. However,
                              retrofitting these buildings is hugely expensive due to the costs of relocation and
                              downtime. As a result, accurate fracture and performance assessment of these buildings is
                              needed to inform tradeoffs between retrofit and non-intervention. The presentation will
                              talk about
                              newly developed assessment methods and tools (developed by a former IIT Bombay student),
                              touching upon fracture mechanics and building performance assessment. Ongoing and future
                              research will also be presented."

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              The Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission, planned for launch in late 2022, will
                              provide a global mapping of the water surface elevation, width and slope of rivers wider
                              than 100m worldwide. The estimation of discharge using solely the SWOT-type observations
                              together with the existing satellite data has received a noticeable attention recently.
                              The attempts to solve this problem have expectedly confirmed that it is ill posed and
                              additional data could be needed, such as the estimates of the mean, minimum and maximum
                              discharge from the available global scale hydrological databases. However, taking into
                              account the accuracy of such estimates and the issue of their relevance to the study
                              period, the problem remains challenging. We suggest a new estimation method, designed
                              specially to reduce the solution bias. It combines Bayesian and Variational approaches to
                              improve the algorithm robustness and stability. In this method the likelihood function is
                              computed, allowing a useful analysis of equifinality often encountered in discharge
                              estimation problems for ungauged basins. The algorithm is designed for global and/or
                              basin-scale applications given the multi-level structure of the methodology. The latter
                              involves different levels of complexity in terms of the representation of the flow
                              dynamics and therefore different computational requirements. Here, we investigate
                              discharge and bathymetry estimation under strong uncertainties from SWOT simulations and
                              their combination with optical (Landsat and Sentinel 2) and altimetry (Jason, ENVISAT,
                              Sentinel 3) data. The global application involves a Python low-cost algorithm that will be
                              run globally through the Confluence platform implemented by UMass.

                              The current constellation offers new opportunities of real time monitoring applications of
                              continental waters and climate change impact studies.
                              Such applications will be fostered and improved by the forthcoming SWOT mission and by
                              future inovative initiatives to come."

                              "Worldwide there is tremendous growth in offshore wind with about 200 operating offshore
                              windfarms and over 5000 offshore wind turbines which are producing about 50GW of Energy.
                              Offshore wind is now the primary driver of new technology development in offshore
                              engineering and the fastest growing industry within renewable energy sector.
                              Both Indian and the US government announced ambition of producing 30GW of electricity by
                              2030. While both countries are way behind UK, China and Germany in developing offshore
                              wind, the United States has made significant progress in last 6 years. WSP USA is the
                              prime engineering contractor for Vineyard Wind which 1st utility scale (800 MW) wind farm
                              project in the US waters.
                              The presentation will include an overview of offshore wind farm, the status of offshore
                              wind industry in different countries and especially Potential vs Reality in the India and
                              the US. This presentation is intended to be more of a conversation / Q&A rather than a
                              seminar.
                              The presentation will be for ~30 min followed by Q&A for ~20 min. Depending on time, the
                              presentation will get into details of Wind Turbine Support Structure and Offshore
                              Substation Platform."

                              "Air pollution causes approximately 7million deaths per year worldwide and approximately
                              91% of world’s population live in places where air quality exceeds World Health
                              Organisation (WHO) guideline limits. At present, it is the greatest environmental risk to
                              our health and environment. The transport sector and more particularly road-transport
                              emission is a major source of the key pollutants and greenhouse gases. Due to high density
                              of on-road vehicles and due to proximity of pollutant generation to high density urban
                              dwellings the impact of air pollution is higher in urban areas.
                              Emissions from real-world driving are often higher than estimated emission levels based on
                              vehicle emissions standards and type-approval tests in laboratories; consequently the air
                              quality in cities has not improved as originally anticipated from fleet renewal and
                              stringent emission regulations. To address this discrepancy, the REDMAP project measured &
                              modelled real world emissions (including NO, NO2, PM and Ammonia) from in-use vehicles in
                              Dublin City, Ireland using Remote Sensing (RS) and Portable Emission Measurement Systems
                              (PEMS) independently and in combination. The real emission contribution of different
                              vehicles considering Euro standard, fuel type, make, and categories and vehicle
                              modifications were investigated. The results of the measurement campaign and the in-depth
                              analysis will be presented."

                              Complex behaviour from structural systems are becoming increasingly standard in
                              traditional and newer sectors in their operational and extreme conditions of responses.
                              Understanding such behaviours allow us to understand, design, detect challenges, and
                              suggest remedial measures for these structures over their lifetime, making them safer and
                              longer lasting. This talk will discuss how University College Dublin has co-created and
                              implemented several such concepts with undergraduate students, leading to a better
                              understanding of this topic. New ideas, experiments, simulations and collaborations will
                              be discussed along with discussions on how certain impacts were achieved. Several examples
                              will be presented in this regard, especially in the context of practice exchange in
                              pedagogy. Lessons Learnt in this process will also be shared.

                              Cold mix recycling is a sustainable approach on construction of pavements. The cold mix
                              recycling is composed of recycled materials and emulsion and filler. The performance
                              characteristics of cold recycling is important in lab and in the field. Recently the
                              balanced mix design approach is being implemented on understanding performance of cold
                              recycled mixes. The talk will present overview of cold recycling, mix design, and field
                              case study.

                              Pile foundations are the most commonly used deep foundations around the world. In seismic
                              regions of the world like the Himalayan region, North Eastern India or Western states,
                              pile foundations may be subjected to strong earthquake loading during their design life.
                              It is therefore important to understand how pile foundations will perform under such
                              loading. In this lecture the use of dynamic centrifuge modelling to understand the seismic
                              behaviour of pile foundations will be considered, particularly when the foundation is soil
                              is vulnerable to liquefaction. Both the axial behaviour of single piles and pile groups
                              will be considered. New insights into the possible deformation mechanisms of the piles
                              will be presented both under axial and lateral loads. Recent research at University of
                              Cambridge on seismic behaviour of pile foundations in clays will be presented.

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              This presentation will discuss findings from an ongoing research study at Oklahoma State
                              University studying different factors that affect vertical tie reaction forces in
                              ballasted railroad tracks. A combined approach involving field instrumentation and
                              numerical modeling has been adopted for this purpose. Measurements of tie reactions can
                              indicate the load distribution patterns and quality of vertical support along a track.
                              Locations where tie support conditions are not adequate can develop geometry defects,
                              ultimately leading to component failure. Three different approaches hare being adopted in
                              this study to measure the forces being transmitted through the rail-tie interface; this is
                              equal to the tie reaction force. The field instrumentation effort validates an alternative
                              method to measure forces at the rail-tie interface using rail-mounted strain gauges.
                              Results from this approach are compared to two other conventional methods of force
                              measurement, i.e. through the use of load cells (LC), and an instrumented tie plate (ITP).
                              A validated 3-dimensional Finite Element (FE) model is used to support the field-observed
                              trends and explain any observed discrepancy. Parametric analyses using the FE model
                              identify different factors that can contribute to the rail-tie interaction force, thus
                              affecting the instrumentation results. The strain gauge-based approach, using the concept
                              of differential shear strain measurement, has been established as a suitable method for
                              tie reaction force measurement. As an extension of this concept, the next phase of this
                              research study is looking at the use of Optical Fiber Sensors for continuous (both spatial
                              as well as temporal) monitoring of track substructure conditions.

                            Steel-plate concrete (SC) composite walls are being used in the construction of nuclear
                            power plants in the United States and China. The presentation will describe recently
                            completed experimental, analytical and numerical studies on large-size SC wall piers
                            subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane loadings that simulated the effects of extreme
                            earthquake shaking. The in-plane force and deformation capacity of SC walls, important for
                            characterizing performance of nuclear facilities under beyond-design- basis loadings and
                            for seismic probabilistic risk assessment, is substantially affected by the magnitude of
                            the out-of-plane loadings. Recommendations for design and detailing of SC walls in nuclear
                            power plants will be presented.

                            Bayesian statistics is a mathematical description of taking into account all prior
                            knowledge along with developing a model. We construct a posterior distribution from which
                            we can derive the optimal parameters (optimization) and obtain the uncertainty estimates
                            (sampling). Complex models require efficient ways of exploring the posterior. We give an
                            overview of how the algorithms are constructed, starting from the basic Metropolis
                            algorithm and address the dependencies on the tuning parameters. It is currently not known
                            how to choose the best performing sampler given the properties of the posterior, such as
                            high dimensionality, strong non-linear correlation and multimodality. We test jump moves
                            underlying popular software packages (EMCEE and DREAM) in controlled settings and make an
                            appraisal of their performance based on methods from statistical physics.

                            Sanda Dejanic has graduated in Astrophysics at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of
                            Belgrade. During her studies she focused her research on spectroscopy. She went twice to
                            summer practices in Ondrejov, Czech Republic and she was a part of the first LEAPS project
                            in Leiden, The Netherlands. At that moment she already wanted to focus her future research
                            in a more applied field. After graduation, she became enrolled in the QUICS project where
                            she is now an EU Marie Curie Fellow. Her host institution is EAWAG, Switzerland and the
                            topic she is focusing on is Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers for Bayesian inference. The
                            aim is providing easy to use software for environmental scientists to achieve more
                            reliable prediction uncertainty and therefore more reliable predictions.

                            Environmental models need input data and data for calibration and validation. For the
                            input of distributed hydrological models as well as for spatial analysis, we need to
                            interpolate a target variable from a finite number of spatial observations (e.g. rainfall,
                            temperature, soil variable). As a consequence, the accuracy of the interpolated maps will
                            depend partly on the sampling location of the observations. The aim of this presentation
                            is to present how to optimize sampling patterns to gain maximum information for a given
                            budget and how to find the optimal sampling design for minimization of a given criterion.
                            The presentation is structured in three chapters. In the first chapter we review some
                            knowledge on space and space-time interpolation to produce maps, which can later be used
                            as input for environmental models. In the second chapter we show how we can re-organize a
                            sampling design in order to find an optimal sampling pattern for our model. The last
                            chapter is a computer example. Ten sampling locations are added manually to a case study
                            for prediction of a soil pollution variable. We demonstrate that sampling theory can help
                            to obtain the best locations.

                            Accurately predicting changes in water quantity and water quality is important for
                            managing hydrologic catchments, be they urban or rural. Due to the complexity of
                            hydrologic processes, with process variability at several scales, deterministic forecasts
                            for natural or engineered catchments are seldom accurate. Uncertainty quantification helps
                            to better assess the accuracy of model predictions and helps improve the predictive
                            capabilities of our models. This talk will discuss the use of Machine Learning (ML) and
                            Gaussian processes as uncertainty descriptors in hydrologic modelling. Special ML
                            techniques can be used in the post processing phase of the forecast for uncertainty
                            estimation. Also, Gaussian processes can be used to explicitly add stochasticity to
                            models. After such a description of uncertainty, parameter estimation can be carried out
                            within a Bayesian framework. Application of these uncertainty estimation techniques on
                            various catchments will be discussed during the presentation.

                            <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                            This seminar presents a framework for incorporation of parameters relating to 'Particle
                            Size Distribution' (PSD), or 'gradation curve' in the constitutive description of
                            unsaturated soils at low degrees of saturation. Unsaturated soils have
                            'self-equilibrating' initial stresses arising from surface tension forces acting on water
                            menisci which depend on micro-structure of saturation. The latter in turn can be related
                            to PSD if simple shape of particles, spherical or elliptical, is assumed. Assuming further
                            an idealised micro-structure of saturation in which both water and air phases of soil are
                            continuous, i.e. a scenario corresponding to low degrees of saturation, it is shown how
                            the response of soils having same initial void ratio and the same degree of saturation is
                            influenced by the gradation curve. The current approaches of modelling the behaviour of
                            Retention Characteristics (SWRC)' as independent inputs, in a rather ad-hoc manner. In
                            contrast to this, in the proposed framework of description of mechanical behaviour of
                            unsaturated soils, gradation curves of soil is adopted as an independent input. It is
                            shown that this is a rational choice consistent with concepts of basic mechanics of soils.
                            An approximate relationship between degree of saturation (Sr) and suction is established
                            for assemblage of uniform sized spherical particles having pendular saturation. The method
                            is then extended to soils of given PSD curves. The parameter required for the description
                            of mechanical behaviour unsaturated soils as indicated in the previous seminar viz. a
                            measure of 'average' pore size is determined. Numerical simulation of triaxial tests
                            indicate that soils having the same initial void ratio and the same initial conditions but
                            different gradation curve can have significantly different mechanical response to the same
                            imposed stress path. The need for more controlled bespoke laboratory experiments to
                            enhance the usefulness of the approach will be emphasized.

                            need to be minimized before attempting seafloor classification. Recent studies (discussed
                            in this presentation) has shown that improved seafloor classification can be attempted
                            using multifrequency backscatter data (for example 40 kHz to 300 kHz). While this ideally
                            should reduce ambiguities in seafloor classification, it requires data collection by
                            either simultaneous operation of multiple sonars or operation of a single sonar
                            simultaneously at multiple frequencies. This approach further demands highest possible
                            radiometric corrections to be applied to the backscatter data. For a given configuration
                            of a multibeam sonar, multiple sectors and swaths are used to maintain motion
                            stabilization and to obtain an even sounding density. Furthermore as the sensor altitude
                            varies, all of the pulse-length, sector spacing, and center frequency changes. All of
                            these add complications in removing the system-specific radiation overprint on the
                            backscatter data. In this presentation, a brief introduction to ocean mapping, multibeam
                            sonars, motion stabilization and its effect on backscatter data are discussed. A newly
                            developed radiation pattern removal approach is presented. Results of improved seafloor
                            classification from recent surveys off the coast of Virginia (onboard NOAA ship Thomas
                            Jefferson) and off the coast of Ireland (onboard RV Celtic Explorer) are discussed.

                            <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                            The Global Earthquake Model (GEM) is a collaborative, non-profit scientific organization
                            that aims to provide datasets, models and state-of-the-art tools for transparent
                            assessment of earthquake hazard and risk. As part of this goal, GEM has developed the
                            OpenQuake engine (an open-source software for hazard and risk calculations), the OpenQuake
                            platform ( a web-based portal making GEM's resources and datasets freely available to all
                            potential users), and a suite of tools to support modelers in the development of hazard,
                            exposure, and vulnerability models. Open-source software and careful documentation of the
                            methodologies create full transparency of the modelling process, so that results can be
                            reproduced any time by third parties. This talk aims to provide a brief overview of the
                            GEM Foundation and highlight some of the useful resources compiled by GEM and its network
                            of collaborators
                            Local experts are key to define the seismic hazard, exposure and vulnerability for their
                            region and can also contribute to the validation of global standards and data. Through
                            regional programmes in Europe, the Americas, the Middle-East, and most of Asia, GEM has
                            been working together with international and local experts to address cross-border issues,
                            share knowledge, data and regional best practice and facilitate technology transfer.
                            Resources compiles by GEM are being used extensively across the world in hazard and risk
                            assessment, from individual practitioners to local and national institutions, and in
                            regional projects to inform disaster risk reduction. This talk highlights some practical
                            examples on how the GEM Foundation is bridging the gap between science and disaster risk
                            reduction in different regions of the world.

                            Dr. Anirudh Rao is a Seismic Risk Engineer at the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation
                            in Pavia, Italy. Anirudh obtained his B.Tech (2008) in Civil Engineering at the Indian
                            Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB). He also earned his M.S. (2010) and Ph.D. (2014) in
                            Structural Engineering at Stanford University. His graduate research work at the John A.
                            Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford focused on the development of a
                            methodology for the time-dependent seismic risk assessment of ageing infrastructure
                            elements subject to long-term deterioration processes like corrosion. At Stanford, Anirudh
                            was involved in projects dealing with tsunami risk mitigation in Indonesia, and flood risk
                            mitigation in Thailand. As part of the seismic risk engineering team at GEM, his current
                            role entails creating both probabilistic and scenario-based seismic risk models and
                            implementing them within the OpenQuake engine (GEM's open-source software for seismic
                            hazard and risk calculations). His work involves developing physical vulnerability and
                            fragility models using both empirical and analytical methodologies; creation of exposure
                            models; development of tools for fragility, vulnerability and exposure modelling; and
                            rigorous scientific testing and verification of the methodologies within the OpenQuake
                            engine. He also frequently conducts workshops and training sessions on seismic risk
                            assessment in regions across the globe.

                              NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) provides a unique collaborative platform for scientists and
                              researchers around the world to do research in a scientifically complex area. NEX provides
                              customized open source tools, scientific workflows, access to petabytes of satellite and
                              climate data, models and computing power. Over the past three years, NEX has evolved in
                              terms of handling projects that deal with data complexity, model integration, and
                              high-performance computing. Another unique aspect of NEX is its collaboration with Amazon
                              Web Services (AWS) to create the OpenNEX platform, which leverages the full stack of AWS's
                              cloud computing platform to demonstrate scientifically relevant projects for government
                              agencies, commercial companies, and other stakeholders. OpenNEX provides access to a wide
                              variety of data through AWS's public datasets program and virtual machines that replicates
                              a certain workflow capturing data access, search, analysis, computation, and
                              visualization. A pressing need in both initiatives is how to deal with large image
                              datasets and efficiently analyze these images using high-performance and cloud computing
                              infrastructures. With funding from several NASA program elements (e.g., AIST, ACCESS,
                              CMS), NEX has showcased activities in which new machine learning algorithms can be
                              deployed and scaled across these computer architectures to process very high-resolution
                              imagery datasets for object classification, segmentation, and feature extraction. An
                              example relates to processing quarter million image scenes from the 1 m multispectral NAIP
                              dataset to estimate tree cover for the continental United States given the large
                              complexities and heterogeneity in land cover types. New computational techniques using
                              open source tools and cloud architecture are a must in achieving performance efficie

                              Streamflow varies greatly in space and time, and the single biggest challenge for water
                              resources engineers around the world is the fact that most streams are ungauged.
                              Furthermore, lack of data hinders streamflow prediction using traditional hydrological
                              models as we cannot determine the values of their parameters. Prediction in ungauged
                              basins thus requires a dynamic 'zero-parameter' hydrological model. One way to achieve
                              this is to follow a regionalization method wherein model parameters are related to easily
                              measurable basin characteristics. However, the applicability of a zero-parameter model
                              obtained through regionalization is limited to 'hydrologically similar" catchments, i.e.,
                              the model is not universal. Interestingly, attempts to develop universal zero-parameter
                              hydrological models were made initially by climatologists, among them Mikhail Budyko was
                              the most popular. Budyko expressed long-term evapotranspiration ratio as a function of
                              'dryness-index.' Thus, by definition, Budyko model cannot be used for dynamic hydrological
                              modelling. To overcome this drawback, an instantaneous dryness index is recently proposed
                              which enables dynamic hydrologic modelling using the original Budyko function. This is
                              achieved by introducing a 'decay function' that characterizes the effects of antecedent
                              rainfall and solar energy on the dryness state of a basin at a time. Consequently, the
                              Budyko function determines the volume of effective rainfall for a given rainfall input at
                              an instant of time. Then, using the same decay function discharge time series is obtained

                              data for a large number of catchments situated in the US and India. Results indicate the

                              Dr. Basudev Biswal is currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of
                              Civil Engineering at I.I.T Hyderabad. He received his PhD from the University of Padova,
                              Italy. His main research interest is in conceptualization of hydrological processes. His
                              work proposes a recession flow model based on the hypothesis that streamflow during dry
                              periods is mainly controlled by channel network morphology. His work also quantitatively
                              demonstrates that basic scale storage-discharge relationship is a time-varying phenomenon.
                              Currently, he is working on development of dynamic zero-parameter hydrological models. His
                              current research interests also include ecosystem modelling and hydrologic transport. More

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              Indian Monsoon provides 80% of the annual rainfall in India and is associated with the
                              northward shift of Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ); governed by large scale
                              circulation. It is believed to be dominated and controlled by distant moisture sources
                              from oceans. However, the contributions from large evapo-transpiration flux, being
                              generated from the land surface processes, specifically from the agriculture intensified
                              Ganga basin, is largely overlooked. Furthermore, regional patterns of monsoon are yet to
                              be simulated reliably, and this is a major gap between the meteorological analysis and the
                              use of the same for local water management. Challenges further increase, when uncertainty
                              starts playing a role and some of them can be sorted out with an understanding of
                              geophysics associated with the behaviour of moisture flux and transport. We use Lagrangian
                              approach to track the moisture from the source to the sink (place of precipitation) during
                              the monsoon season. We find Western, Central and Upper Indian Oceans are the three major
                              oceanic sources and Ganga Basin is a major land source to the monsoon rainfall. With these
                              major sources, we could also explain the inter-annual and intra-seasonal variability of
                              monsoon. Considering the significant impacts from land sources, we test the likely impacts
                              of land use land cover change on rainfall with a regional climate model.
                              The other major land surface process associated with monsoon extremes is urban canopy
                              process. We find urban signature on Indian monsoon extremes in the Central, Western and
                              Southern India. Specific regional climate modelling on the city of Mumbai shows a
                              prominent urban signature on precipitation extremes at a higher quantile. We develop a
                              novel technique of combining statistical and dynamic model for projections of rainfall
                              extremes in Mumbai considering the impacts of climate change and urbanization.

                              Hydrologic remote sensing has made great strides in recent years; none the less being the
                              launch of two soil moisture dedicated satellites. While the ability to monitor this
                              important variable at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale remains an unresolved
                              challenge, we have made significant contributions towards solving this problem through a
                              series of intensive airborne field experiments. However, the real power of hydrologic
                              remote sensing lies not in the derived spatial maps, but rather in how they are used to
                              constrain numerical models. Of particular importance is flood forecast models, with floods
                              resulting in significant devastation every year. An ability to more accurately predict
                              flood extent and flow velocities will undoubtedly lead to a significant reduction in loss
                              of both life and property. Consequently, we have been making contributions towards
                              improved near-real-time precipitation mapping and flood prediction, through model
                              constraint with remotely sensed soil moisture and flood inundation observations, including
                              crowd-sourced imagery. This presentation will overview our activities and recent findings.

                              and MISOs dominating May-September. The transition from MJO to MISO requires a multi-scale
                              approach that includes the global tropical conveyor, viz., the ITCZ and the atmospheric
                              bridge from both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans and the oceanic tunnel from the
                              Pacific via the Indonesian throughflow (ITF). The multi-scale interactions at
                              intraseasonal timescales are critical for the seasonal-to-interannual variability of the
                              monsoons and its interactions with the Indian Ocean Dipole/ Zonal mode and ENSO. A
                              specific example will be used to make the case for an international effort on a
                              multi-scale observational modeling project focused on the MJO-MISO transition in the
                              Indian Ocean. The ITF interacts with the MJO-driven equatorial Kelvin waves that
                              transition to coastal Kelvin waves in the eastern Indian Ocean. The resulting baroclinic
                              instabilities between Java and Australia propagate westward as intraseasonal Rossby waves.
                              These waves are crucial for the mixed layer-thermocline interactions in the southwestern
                              Indian Ocean which is important for MJO genesis. These ITF-MJO interactions also affect
                              the transition to MISO and thus the African-Asian-Australian monsoons and in turn the
                              IODZM and ENSO. The spatio-temporal scale selection of the responses can only be
                              understood in a multi-scale observational-modeling and forecast framework.

                              Swiss Re has started a new initiative in thought leadership called Re-Imagine. Swiss Re
                              Imagine awards is a thought leadership challenge for students to prepare and submit a
                              research paper to one of the topics relevant to Swiss Re. Students are encouraged to form
                              a team of 3 + one alumni (optional) to prepare a case study. Out of all the entries, top
                              10 will be selected to provide mentorship to prepare a research paper or detailed study.
                              Judging criteria will be on innovations, feasibility and usability, level of detail,
                              relevance and overall impact. The talk will focus on this new initiative.

                              This is an introductory lecture of the following ones to be held in the coming months.
                              Prof. Towhata has been involved in many engineering activities to cope with the
                              devastating effects of the earthquake in 2011. The lecture will touch upon the following
                              issues: acceleration records, coseismic subsidence (tectonic subsidence in the earth
                              crust), dam breaching, failure of artificial embankments, liquefaction in man-made islands
                              and disaster of Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant. Further, the talk will also refer to
                              the shortage of goods supply caused by the destruction of transportation routes.

                              Ramp Meters have been used for congestion management on U.S highways since the 1940s to
                              maximize highway capacity by controlling on-ramp flows. In practice, optimal control is
                              not easy to achieve due to the limited storage on the on-ramps. Traditionally, the focus
                              has been to develop real-time algorithms and iterative optimization techniques. This led
                              to a host of algorithms and methods which cannot be proven to provide an optimal control.
                              Moreover, a systematic understanding of the characteristics of optimal control and its
                              influence on traffic dynamics is missing. Towards this end, this talk presents the
                              optimality conditions on long highway corridors to develop ramp metering techniques that
                              carefully take the traffic dynamics into account. A Kinematic Wave Model of the
                              highway-ramps system is optimized for minimal total delay. The optimality conditions for
                              the case of unlimited ramp storage are studied using Moskowitz functions that provide
                              several interesting insights for different scenarios, including the case of limited
                              storage. We show that the current problem posed as a nonlinear coupled PDE system cannot
                              be solved with the existing variational methods and a simulation-based optimization
                              methodology does not provide solutions in reasonable time. To overcome this, we repose the
                              problem as a discrete-time mathematical programming formulation to unveil important
                              relationships between the optimal control and the traffic dynamics. The results indicate
                              that the system-wide optimality can be achieved with local control by tracking the density
                              on the highway and queue length on the on-ramp. This research opens the door to a new set
                              of algorithms that are robust, easily scalable, and transferable with minimal
                              infrastructure needs.

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>

                              Soil erosion and sediment transport in a river basin is a complex problem, which needs
                              much attention to save the reservoirs from sedimentation. The problem depends on the
                              geographical conditions and flow regimes. In this presentation, various experimental and
                              theoretical studies on the physical process of sediment transport will be presented with
                              the science behind the phenomena.

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              Ballasted railways are largest transportation modes offering bulk freight and medium to
                              high speed passenger services covering larger geographical areas in rapidly developing
                              nations, including India. In order to cater for ever-growing demands from both public as
                              well as industrial sectors, conscious efforts have been made in view of improved
                              productivity, technological upgradation and increased safety while maintaining costs of
                              services within affordable range. However, despite these recent advances, ballasted tracks
                              undergo excessive deformation and degradation when subjected to stresses exerted from
                              high-speed passenger trains, seriously affecting lateral stability.

                              In view of this, large-scale laboratory tests, sophisticated numerical models and
                              full-scale field trials were undertaken by the Centre for Geomechanics and Railway
                              Engineering at the University of Wollongong. These research studies have provided
                              significant knowledge to better understand track performance under high amplitude cyclic
                              loads with large frequency contents. Comprehensive field trials were carried out on
                              instrumented track sections in Bulli near Sydney and in Singleton near Newcastle in the
                              state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. In these field studies, different types of
                              geosynthetics were used, with the aim of decreasing track deformations, increasing track
                              resiliency, and reducing ballast degradation. This lecture provides an insight to recent
                              advancements in design and construction of rail tracks capturing the effects of particle
                              degradation, fouling, geosynthetics, increased train speed and axle loads.

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              Coupled climate model simulations are analyzed to quantify the dynamic effect of Southern
                              Ocean (SO) winds on transports in the oceans. It is found that the representation of ocean
                              mesoscale eddies does not allow for a realistic eddy saturation of the zonal transports in
                              the SO in response to the wind changes, and that eddy compensation of the meridional
                              transports in the SO is underestimated too. Despite this underestimated eddy compensation
                              in the SO, however, and in contrast to previous suggestions, the Atlantic Meridional
                              Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength is almost insensitive to SO winds. In the limit of
                              weak SO winds the AMOC waters do not upwell in the SO but in the tropical Indo-Pacific.
                              Through their effect on sea-ice, weaker SO winds also lead to less production of Antarctic
                              Bottom Water and therefore a deeper and stronger AMOC.

                              <h5><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h5>
                              An efficient model for preparing technical papers is posed as a multi-objective
                              optimization problem. The importance of basic structural elements such as figures, tables,
                              sections and appendices is highlighted along with the role of coupling between form and
                              content. Lessons from collective experiences on best practices and reviewer psychology are
                              presented through some examples.
